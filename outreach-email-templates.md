Hi [Agent Name],

I wanted to follow up on my previous email about providing complimentary cleaning vouchers for your property clients.

I understand you're busy showing properties and closing deals. That's exactly why our partnership makes sense - we handle the cleaning logistics so you can focus on what you do best.

Quick benefits for your clients:
‚úì R200 off their first cleaning
‚úì Flexible scheduling around moving dates
‚úì Professional, insured, and vetted cleaners
‚úì One less moving stress for them

I have just 5 vouchers remaining this month. Shall I reserve some for your upcoming closings?

Best,

I'm attaching 3 more vouchers for your upcoming clients. Also, I'd love to feature your testimonial about our partnership if you're comfortable sharing a few words.
