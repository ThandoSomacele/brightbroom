# Deployment Strategy

A well-defined deployment strategy is essential for ensuring reliable and efficient releases of the BrightBroom application. This document outlines our approach to deploying and maintaining the application in various environments.

## Deployment Environments

### 1. Development Environment

The development environment is used by developers for local development and testing.

**Configuration**:

- Local development server
- SQLite database for simplicity
- Mock PayFast integration
- Feature flags enabled for testing new features

**Setup**:

```bash
# Local development setup
npm install
npm run dev

# Run with test data
npm run dev:seed
```

### 2. Staging Environment

The staging environment mimics the production environment and is used for testing before releases.

**Hosting**: Vercel

**Configuration**:

- Connected to the `main` branch
- PostgreSQL database on Neon (staging instance)
- PayFast sandbox environment
- Complete monitoring and logging

**Deployment Process**:

- Automatic deployment on changes to the `main` branch
- Preview deployments for pull requests
- End-to-end tests run against staging environment

### 3. Production Environment

The production environment is the live application used by customers.

**Hosting**: Vercel

**Configuration**:

- Connected to the `production` branch
- PostgreSQL database on Neon (production instance)
- Live PayFast integration
- Full monitoring, logging, and alerting

**Deployment Process**:

- Controlled deployments from the `main` branch to the `production` branch
- Scheduled deployments during low-traffic periods
- Rollback capability for critical issues

## CI/CD Pipeline

### GitHub Actions Workflow

```yaml
# .github/workflows/ci.yml
name: CI/CD Pipeline

      - run: npm run test:integration

  e2e:
    needs: test
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v3
        with:
          node-version: "18"
          cache: "npm"
      - run: npm ci
      - name: Install Playwright
        run: npx playwright install --with-deps
      - name: Build app
        run: npm run build
      - name: Run E2E tests
        run: npm run test:e2e

  deploy-staging:
    needs: [test, e2e]
    if: github.ref == 'refs/heads/main'
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - uses: amondnet/vercel-action@v20
        with:
          vercel-token: ${{ secrets.VERCEL_TOKEN }}
          vercel-org-id: ${{ secrets.VERCEL_ORG_ID }}
          vercel-project-id: ${{ secrets.VERCEL_PROJECT_ID }}
          scope: ${{ secrets.VERCEL_ORG_ID }}

  deploy-production:
    needs: [test, e2e]
    if: github.ref == 'refs/heads/production'
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    environment: production
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - uses: amondnet/vercel-action@v20
        with:
          vercel-token: ${{ secrets.VERCEL_TOKEN }}
          vercel-org-id: ${{ secrets.VERCEL_ORG_ID }}
          vercel-project-id: ${{ secrets.VERCEL_PROJECT_ID }}
          scope: ${{ secrets.VERCEL_ORG_ID }}
          vercel-args: "--prod"
```

## Database Migration Strategy

Database migrations are managed using Prisma Migrate:

1. **Development**: Generate and apply migrations locally
2. **Staging**: Apply migrations automatically during deployment
3. **Production**: Apply migrations manually after review

**Migration Commands**:

```bash
# Generate a new migration
npx prisma migrate dev --name add_feature_x

# Apply migrations in production
npx prisma migrate deploy
```

**Best Practices**:

- Always review migrations before applying in production
- Back up the database before applying migrations
- Test migrations in a staging environment first
- Use incremental changes rather than large schema changes

## Environment Configuration

Environment variables are managed securely:

1. **Local Development**: `.env` file (gitignored)
2. **Vercel Environments**: Environment variables in Vercel dashboard
3. **Secrets Management**: Sensitive credentials stored in Vercel secrets

**Example Configuration**:

```
# Database
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://...

# Authentication
AUTH_SECRET=...

# PayFast
VITE_PAYFAST_MERCHANT_ID=...
VITE_PAYFAST_MERCHANT_KEY=...
VITE_PAYFAST_PASSPHRASE=...
VITE_PAYFAST_URL=...

# Application
VITE_APP_URL=https://brightbroom.app
VITE_API_URL=https://brightbroom.app/api
```

## Monitoring and Logging

### Monitoring Tools

1. **Vercel Analytics**: For performance and usage metrics
2. **Upstash Monitoring**: For Redis monitoring
3. **Neon Monitoring**: For database performance
4. **Sentry**: For error tracking and performance monitoring

### Logging Strategy

1. **Structured Logging**: JSON format for machine parsing
2. **Log Levels**: Error, warn, info, debug
3. **Contextual Information**: Request IDs, user IDs, timestamps
4. **PII Protection**: Redaction of sensitive information

**Implementation**:

```typescript
// src/lib/server/logger.ts
import { createLogger } from 'winston';

export const logger = createLogger({
  level: import.meta.env.DEV ? 'debug' : 'info',
  format: /* JSON format configuration */,
  transports: [/* Transport configuration */]
});

// Usage
logger.info('Booking created', {
  bookingId: booking.id,
  userId: user.id,
  serviceId: booking.serviceId
});
```

## Backup Strategy

1. **Database Backups**:

   - Daily automated backups with Neon
   - Weekly full backups stored in separate storage
   - 30-day retention period
   - Tested restoration process

2. **Application State**:
   - Infrastructure as code for deployment configuration
   - Source control for all application code
   - Documentation of all third-party service configurations

## Scaling Strategy

### Horizontal Scaling

The application is designed to scale horizontally:

1. **Stateless Design**: No server-side session state
2. **CDN Integration**: Static assets served through Vercel's CDN
3. **Edge Functions**: Utilize Vercel Edge Functions for improved performance

### Vertical Scaling

1. **Database Scaling**: Upgrade Neon database tiers as needed
2. **Caching Layer**: Implement Redis caching for frequently accessed data
3. **Resource Optimisation**: Regular performance profiling and optimisation

## Disaster Recovery

1. **Recovery Time Objective (RTO)**: 1 hour
2. **Recovery Point Objective (RPO)**: 24 hours
3. **Incident Response Plan**:
   - Defined roles and responsibilities
   - Communication templates
   - Rollback procedures
   - Post-incident review process

## Security Measures

1. **HTTPS Everywhere**: All traffic encrypted with TLS
2. **Headers Security**:

   - Content Security Policy
   - Strict Transport Security
   - XSS Protection
   - Frame Options

3. **Regular Security Audits**:
   - Automated security scanning
   - Dependency vulnerability checking
   - Manual penetration testing

## Compliance

1. **GDPR Compliance**:

   - Data retention policies
   - Right to be forgotten implementation
   - Privacy policy

2. **PCI DSS Compliance**:
   - No storage of payment details
   - Secure payment processing through PayFast
   - Regular security audits

## Release Management

### Release Cycle

1. **Sprint Cycle**: 2-week development sprints
2. **Release Schedule**: Bi-weekly releases to production
3. **Hotfixes**: Expedited process for critical bug fixes

### Release Process

1. **Feature Branches**: Development on feature branches
2. **Pull Requests**: Code review and automated testing
3. **Staging Deployment**: Testing in staging environment
4. **Production Deployment**: Scheduled deployment to production
5. **Post-Release Monitoring**: Tracking metrics and error rates

### Feature Flags

Feature flags are used to safely roll out new features:

```typescript
// src/lib/config/features.ts
export const features = {
  NEW_BOOKING_FLOW: import.meta.env.VITE_FEATURE_NEW_BOOKING_FLOW === 'true',
  ADVANCED_SCHEDULING: import.meta.env.VITE_FEATURE_ADVANCED_SCHEDULING === 'true',
  RECURRING_BOOKINGS: import.meta.env.VITE_FEATURE_RECURRING_BOOKINGS === 'true'
};

// Usage
import { features } from '$lib/config/features';

{#if features.NEW_BOOKING_FLOW}
  <NewBookingComponent />
{:else}
  <LegacyBookingComponent />
{/if}
```

## Versioning

1. **Semantic Versioning**: Major.Minor.Patch format
2. **Release Notes**: Detailed changelog for each release
3. **API Versioning**: Version prefix for API endpoints

## Post-Deployment Verification

1. **Smoke Tests**: Automated tests for critical paths
2. **Manual Verification**: Checklist of key functionality
3. **Gradual Rollout**: Monitor performance and errors before full release

## Rollback Strategy

In case of critical issues:

1. **Code Rollback**: Revert to previous version in Vercel
2. **Database Rollback**: Restore from backup if needed
3. **Communication Plan**: Notify users of temporary issues
