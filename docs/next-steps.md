2. **Booking Essentials**
   - Service selection
   - Address management
   - Date and time selection
   - Booking confirmation

3. **Payment Processing**
   - PayFast integration
   - Payment confirmation
   - Basic receipt generation

4. **Admin Essentials**
   - Booking management
   - User management
   - Basic reporting

### Nice-to-Have Features

1. **Enhanced User Experience**

   - Cleaner performance metrics
   - Revenue reports

## Technical Debt Considerations

Areas to monitor for potential technical debt:

1. **Type Safety**
   - Ensure comprehensive TypeScript coverage
   - Avoid `any` types and use proper interfaces

2. **Test Coverage**
   - Maintain adequate test coverage for core functionality
   - Avoid pushing untested code to production

3. **Documentation**
   - Keep architecture documentation updated
   - Document complex business logic
   - Maintain code comments for non-obvious implementations

4. **Dependency Management**
   - Regularly update dependencies
   - Minimize unnecessary dependencies
   - Monitor for security vulnerabilities

## Risk Assessment and Mitigation

| Risk | Impact | Probability | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|------------|
| Payment integration complexity | High | Medium | Start with simplified flow, thorough testing, fallback mechanisms |
| Performance issues with complex booking logic | Medium | Medium | Early performance testing, optimization, caching |
| User adoption challenges | High | Medium | Usability testing, simplified MVP flow, customer feedback |
| Security vulnerabilities | High | Low | Regular security audits, following best practices, penetration testing |
| Database scalability | Medium | Low | Proper indexing, query optimization, monitoring |

## Success Metrics

Key metrics to track for measuring success:

1. **User Engagement**
   - User registration rate
   - Booking completion rate
   - Return customer percentage

2. **Technical Performance**
   - Page load times
   - API response times
   - Error rates

3. **Business Metrics**
   - Revenue per booking
   - Customer acquisition cost
   - Customer satisfaction score

## Collaboration Guidelines

### Git Workflow

1. **Branch Naming Convention**
   - Feature branches: `feature/feature-name`
   - Bug fixes: `fix/bug-description`
   - Releases: `release/version-number`

2. **Commit Message Standards**
   - Use conventional commits format
   - Include ticket/issue reference when applicable

3. **Pull Request Process**
   - Create descriptive PR title and description
   - Include screenshots for UI changes
   - Require at least one code review
   - Ensure all tests pass

### Code Standards

1. **Formatting and Linting**
   - Use Prettier for formatting
   - Follow ESLint rules
   - Run linting as part of CI/CD

2. **Component Structure**
   - One component per file
   - Use TypeScript for props definition
   - Follow accessibility best practices

3. **Documentation Requirements**
   - Document complex functions
   - Include component usage examples
   - Document API endpoints
