# Routing Fix for BrightBroom

## Issue Fixed

The "Apply Now" button in the contact page was linking to `/join/cleaner`, but this route wasn't working properly. When users clicked this button, the page wasn't rendering as expected.

## Root Cause Analysis

The issue was related to SvelteKit's routing architecture. The route structure was incomplete:

1. The `/join/cleaner` route had a component but the parent `/join` route didn't have proper layout and page components.
2. SvelteKit requires parent routes to have either layout files or page files to properly handle nested routes.

## Changes Made

1. Added a minimal layout component for the `/join` route:
   ```svelte
   <!-- src/routes/join/+layout.svelte -->
   <script>
     // This is a simple layout for the /join route to ensure proper routing
   </script>

   <slot />
   ```

2. Added a redirect page for the `/join` route that forwards users to `/join/cleaner`:
   ```svelte
   <!-- src/routes/join/+page.svelte -->
   <script>
     import { goto } from '$app/navigation';
     import { onMount } from 'svelte';
     
     // Redirect to cleaner application page
     onMount(() => {
       goto('/join/cleaner');
     });
   </script>

   <div class="min-h-screen flex items-center justify-center">
     <p class="text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-300">Redirecting to cleaner application...</p>
   </div>
   ```

## Benefits

1. The "Apply Now" button now correctly routes users to the cleaner application form
2. The routing structure follows SvelteKit's conventions
3. Users visiting `/join` will be automatically redirected to `/join/cleaner` 
4. Improved user experience with no broken navigation paths

## Recommended Future Improvements

1. Consider adding proper loading states during navigation
2. Add more comprehensive error handling for the cleaner application form
3. Consider adding a "breadcrumb" navigation component to show users where they are in the site structure
