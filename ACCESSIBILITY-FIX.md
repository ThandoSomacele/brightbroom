# Accessibility Fixes for BrightBroom

## Issues Fixed

We fixed several accessibility issues that were causing warnings during the build process:

### 1. Form labels without proper control associations in `join/cleaner/+page.svelte`

- Fixed 3 issues where form labels were not properly associated with their controls:
  - Availability checkboxes
  - Transport selection radio buttons
  - WhatsApp selection radio buttons

### 2. Click events without keyboard handlers in modal components

- Fixed 2 components with click events that needed keyboard handlers and proper ARIA roles:
  - `components/services/ServiceDetailsModal.svelte`
  - `components/booking/ServiceDetailsModal.svelte`

## Approach Used

For group form controls (checkboxes, radio buttons), we:
1. Changed `<label>` tags without associated controls to `<p>` tags with unique IDs
2. Added `aria-labelledby` attributes to the containing divs referencing these IDs
3. Added `role="radiogroup"` to the radio button containers

For modals with click handlers, we:
1. Added the `role="presentation"` attribute to the modal backdrop divs
2. Added keyboard event handlers with `on:keydown` attributes
3. Ensured proper keyboard navigation and escape key functionality

## Benefits

- Improved accessibility for screen reader users
- Better keyboard navigation
- Compliance with WCAG guidelines
- Clean build with no accessibility warnings

## Remaining Warnings

There is a non-critical warning about unused imports that remains:
- "addWeeks" is imported from "date-fns" but never used in some files

This warning doesn't affect functionality or accessibility and could be addressed in a future update.
